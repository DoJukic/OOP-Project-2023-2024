General appearance:
- Dark background
- Smoke effect on bottom ~2/5 of screen (moving?)

Loading screen:
- Show image of loaded cup on top, loading circle below it, centered obv.
- Every loop of loading circle check status of load? Make sure laoding screen is seen so it isn't wasted effort like the overly multithreaded file source checks
- BG needs to be partially transparent and otherwise dark so this can be displayed over things

Teams view:
- Selected team on left or top, depending on how much screen we're working with - ratio where screen X is less than Y make things to top to bottom?
- OPFOR right or bottom
